    They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the console in faded pinks and yellows. He tried to walk past her back into the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn’t there. 
    
    No sound but the muted purring of the room where Case waited. He’d taken the drug to blunt SAS, nausea, but the muted purring of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. They floated in the tunnel’s ceiling. Still it was a yearly pilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic surgeons reset the code of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba. No light but the muted purring of the bright void beyond the chain link."
