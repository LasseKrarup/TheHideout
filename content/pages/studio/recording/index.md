    The heart of the studio is our control room. Dominated by old-school
    analogue equipment combined with modern hardware and software. 


    The main recording room which measures 150 square meters have all your heart might desire including old Vox and Fender amplifiers as well as our 1896 Steinway & Sons B211 grand piano.


    The secondary recording room is ideal for isolating acoustic instruments or vocals during full band recording sessions. 


    All gear in the studio is at your free disposal.


    We also offer both mixing and mastering for your projects whether or not your recording has been done in-house.
