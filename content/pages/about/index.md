    Music Studio in the heart of Aalborg Denmark. 




    The heart of the studio is our control room. Dominated by old-school analogue equipment combined with modern hardware and software. 


    The main recording room have all your heart might desire including old Vox and Fender amplifiers as well as our 1896 Steinway & Sons B211 grand piano.


    The secondary recording room is ideal for isolating acoustic instruments or vocals during full band recording sessions.


    All gear in the studio is at your free disposal.
